This card is <b>Provided free by the governement.</b> All stores a nave a backup cards.</p>
	            <div class="import"><p><mark>With this, we can <b>incredibly reduce the amount of material we use like paper and factories </b>that we would otherwise use for paper cash.</mark></p></div>

<br />
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px;">Our community uses no fossil fuels. Transport can be done by one of three ways</p>
<u class="transtable">
    <li>Electric vehicles(Includes Trains)</li>
    <li>Horse</li>
    <li>Foot</li>
</u>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px;">All transportation imported like vehicles have to be eco-friendly to produce and use. They also must follow our <a href="#laws">importation rules on our law and order section</a>. Due to currency conversion and government incentives,<b>electric cars are economically viable</b>. If you plan to transport by horse then you must apply for a license. Most jobs require transportation, if so we provide the license and training <b>at no cost</b></div>.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:25px;">If you were to have a horse, use of the animal will be closely monitored so we know if you are treating the horse properly.</p>

	<h2>Tech is an important part of Education</h2>
	<p style="color:black;">Everyone is granted education. Education Starts at age 5 in elementary school. At the age of 8, students will learn start to learn some more tech skills. Students education gets more tech based as they get older. At age 10, the last year of elementary school, we start to tech kids to code. Coding gets more advanced later on in their education.</p>

<p style="color:black;">
It goes in this order: age 5-8 - regular normal school, age 8 - 10 - teaches kids more advanced computer skills, age 10 - 11 Teaches HTML/CSS (coding language used to make web pages), age 12 - 13 teaches JavaScript(used to make webapps like google docs) and the extensions of Angularjs and jQuery. Age 13 - 16 - Teaches Java, Perl, PHP, and .NET which are used for security. Age 16 - Till end of college - Teaches the C language which is used in games and security. On top of this you will learn your skill. 
</p>
<p style="color:black;">Ages of college varies till 20-22. Education including college is mandatory for all.</p>

	   <center> <h1 style="color:white;">Laws</h1></center>
	   <h1>	All our laws are made and check so they can protect the people, the people's belongings and the environment.</h1>
	   <p>We have four main general laws that branch out to multiple different laws in our society. All 
	   other laws are based on these ones. The laws are:</p>
	<pre>
    There is no Violence are community
    Your Shall help if someone is in need
    No  bribery or stealing
    No destruction of the environment.
    </pre>
    <h2>Importation/Exportation laws</h2>
    <p>Our economy is largely based on import and export. This makes the environment here such a great way to live economically and visually. A big law here is that the buyer/seller must be very eco-friendly and have a history of supporting the environment.The buyer/seller must also have no corruption or political interference. Trades are subject to review and can be vetoed by the people if the deal harmful or unbeneficial. To keep you, the people, safe ALL IMPORT AND EXPORTS MUST BE CHECK BY OUR POLICE. All these makes society a tremendous center of trade.
</p>
<h2>Family Laws</h2>
<p>Families make a big part of our society and a center of our focus. In order to Must be 22 to be married. After you make the age requirement, you must have least 3 years together with your partner to married. Once you married, you have children, although you must be 28 to have children. There are no limits on how many kids you can have but you MUST make sure that you can economically and emotionally eligible to have one. Once you are married, you are allowed to purchase a small house, once you have a child, you must move into a small house or bigger, the more children you have, bigger house you need. This are just the principles of our family laws.
</p>
<h2>Other Important Information</h2>
<p>Our police are allowed to take disciplinary action if any law is broken. No police caries and firearm or anything that can cause death or injury. Firearms are only allowed in very intense issues. This assures a safe police environment.
	The citizens of the community can, through voting, can veto,take out, and create laws. This brings power to the people. </p>

	<section id="house" class="house">
	  <center><h1 style="color:white;">Envirornment and Housing</h1></center>
	  <h1>We are all about going green. Green is the future, no doubt about it. Everyone's doing it and so are we.</h1>
	  <h2>Energy</h2>
	  <p>We use solar and wind energy here in EcoTech Land. Were fortunate to be located in a sunny area where we get lots of wind. We have vast areas of land in which we utilize these renewable sources of energy. Due to our massive energy farm system, energy here is quite cheap, lower the citizens cost of living. This also helps lower CO2 emissions, restoring the environment.
</p>
    <h2>Our climate</h2>
    <p>We have a hot climate, with the occasional rain. It is quite windy in the plains. It rarely snows here. We believe that in order for nature to be safe, we cannot mess around with it, so that is why we do not have any climate control procedures in place.</p>
    <h2>Vegetation/Meats</h2>
    <p>As you seen above we have farmer as a job. We have acres of land dedicated for farming. We mainly farm crops full of nutrient. We also have cows, pigs, chickens, and bulls that we raise. Being vegetarian is not  law but most people here would be.</p>
    <h2>Our housing</h2>
    <p>We have the most advance housing you have ever seen. All houses come with new technology. Each house has a voice assistant, computer, tv, all utilities and high speed internet. Houses uses eco friendly and modern material giving you a great experience. There are three house classes, apartments,small houses and big houses. At the age of 18 you leave home and go to an apartment. When you get married, you have to option to move into a small house but are forced into one after the first child. Big houses are reserved for families with over 2 children.</p>

	    <h1>Online Security</h1>
	    <h3>You saw that our community uses lots of computers. You might be thinking: how will you keep the community with all the danger of the internet? We have already thought of that.</h3>
	    <h2>Quantum Computers</h2>
	    <p>Quantum computers are special high end computer, faster that most computers today that uses a quantum mechanics which is too difficult to explain so in short terms, makes a fast computer. So we have three of these computers all protected the community by filtering out bad website and blockout and hacker inside or out. Everything gets filtered through this computer which make an open safe internet for all.
</p>
	    <h2>The Quantum Convention</h2>
	    <p>Twice a year, we hold a convention where all citizens can attend, where they can give suggestion about the security system and also input their own code to make it better. At the end it is great event to be at.</p>
